# Between Stages

The Alpaca lexer and parser are two independent compilation stages connected by a single data contract: the `Lexeme`.
When you call `tokenize()`, the lexer matches tokens against the input, runs its post-match update after each match, and collects the results into a `List[Lexeme]`.
When you call `parse()`, the parser consumes that list.
The post-match update is responsible for advancing the text cursor, applying tracking-field and rule-body context changes, and constructing each lexeme with its context snapshot.

Most programs need nothing more than this:

```scala sc-name:otm-brainfuck
import halotukozak.alpaca.*

case class BrainLexContext(
  squareBrackets: Int = 0,
) extends LexerCtx

val BrainLexer = lexer[BrainLexContext]:
  case ">" => Token["next"]
  case "<" => Token["prev"]
  case "\\+" => Token["inc"]
  case "-" => Token["dec"]
  case "\\." => Token["print"]
  case "\\[" =>
    ctx.squareBrackets += 1
    Token["jumpForward"]
  case "\\]" =>
    require(ctx.squareBrackets > 0, "Mismatched brackets")
    ctx.squareBrackets -= 1
    Token["jumpBack"]

enum BrainAST:
  case Root(ops: List[BrainAST])
  case While(ops: List[BrainAST])
  case Next, Prev, Inc, Dec, Print

object BrainParser extends Parser:
  val root: Rule[BrainAST] = rule:
    case Operation.List(stmts) => BrainAST.Root(stmts)

  val While: Rule[BrainAST] = rule:
    case (BrainLexer.jumpForward(_), Operation.List(stmts), BrainLexer.jumpBack(_)) =>
      BrainAST.While(stmts)

  val Operation: Rule[BrainAST] = rule(
    { case BrainLexer.next(_) => BrainAST.Next },
    { case BrainLexer.prev(_) => BrainAST.Prev },
    { case BrainLexer.inc(_) => BrainAST.Inc },
    { case BrainLexer.dec(_) => BrainAST.Dec },
    { case BrainLexer.print(_) => BrainAST.Print },
    { case While(whl) => whl },
  )
```

```scala sc-compile-with:otm-brainfuck
val (finalCtx, lexemes) = BrainLexer.tokenize("[>+<-]")
val (_, ast) = BrainParser.parse(lexemes)
```

This page explains what is inside those lexemes, how the pipeline advances the context, and how the data flows between stages.

## Connecting Lexer Output to Parser Input

The `tokenize()` method returns a named tuple `(ctx: Ctx, lexemes: List[Lexeme])`:

```scala sc-compile-with:otm-brainfuck
val (finalCtx, lexemes) = BrainLexer.tokenize("++[>+<-].")

// finalCtx holds the final lexer context state
// lexemes holds the matched tokens (Token.Ignored entries are excluded)

val (_, ast) = BrainParser.parse(lexemes)
```

The parser accepts `List[Lexeme[?, ?]]` and appends `Lexeme.EOF` internally before processing begins. You do not need to add an end-of-input marker yourself.

The final context (the tuple's `ctx` field) is useful for post-tokenization checks. For example, the BrainFuck lexer tracks bracket depth — after tokenization, you can verify all brackets are balanced:

```scala sc-compile-with:otm-brainfuck
val (finalCtx, lexemes) = BrainLexer.tokenize("[>+<-]")
require(finalCtx.squareBrackets == 0, "Mismatched brackets")
val (_, ast) = BrainParser.parse(lexemes)
```

## The Post-Match Update

The `lexer` macro derives the per-token update from the context's case fields. There is no hook to override; instead you compose behaviour from smaller pieces:

- **Tracking fragments** — a field whose type provides a `given Tracking[F]` advances automatically after every match. `Column` and `Line` are built in; you can define your own (see [Lexer Context](lexer-context.md#the-post-match-update)).
- **Rule bodies** — assignments like `ctx.squareBrackets += 1` are rewritten into a functional `copy`, so a field with no `Tracking` changes only where a rule says so.
- **Post-tokenization checks** — read the final `ctx` returned by `tokenize()` for anything that only makes sense once the whole input is consumed.

For per-token side effects that live outside the context entirely — writing to an external log, emitting metrics — put the effect in the rule body itself. It runs once per match, in match order.

```scala sc-compile-with:otm-brainfuck
val LoggingLexer = lexer[BrainLexContext]:
  case "\\[" =>
    ctx.squareBrackets += 1
    println(s"open at depth ${ctx.squareBrackets}")
    Token["jumpForward"]
  case "\\]" =>
    ctx.squareBrackets -= 1
    Token["jumpBack"]
```

## Data Flow Summary

Each call to `tokenize()` follows this sequence:

1. The lexer attempts to match the remaining input against each rule pattern in order. The first match wins. If no pattern matches, the context's `ErrorHandling` strategy decides what happens (by default, a `RuntimeException` with the unexpected character).
2. Each tracked field's `Tracking` update runs, producing a fresh context via one functional `copy`.
3. The rule body's context changes (`ctx.field = ...`) are applied, again as a `copy`.
4. The text cursor (`ctx.text`) advances past the matched string and the matched text is recorded in `ctx.lastRawMatched`.
5. For a `DefinedToken`, a `Lexeme` is built from the token name, value, and a snapshot of the context's case fields, with `text` set to the matched string. `Token.Ignored` (and recovery tokens) still run steps 2–4 but emit no `Lexeme` — they are invisible to the parser.
6. This repeats until the entire input is consumed. `tokenize()` then returns the named tuple `(ctx, lexemes)` -- the final context state and the complete lexeme list.
7. `parse(lexemes)` receives the list, appends `Lexeme.EOF` internally, and runs the parser grammar against the sequence.

The `Lexeme` list is immutable after `tokenize()` returns. The parser does not alter the lexeme data.
