Context-free grammars are the backbone of syntactic analysis. A grammar defines a language by specifying how symbols can be combined and rewritten — "context-free" means each rule applies regardless of surrounding context. If the lexer is the vocabulary of a language, the grammar is its syntax.

## What is a Context-Free Grammar?

A grammar consists of a set of non-terminal symbols (grammar variables that can be expanded), a set of terminal symbols (the tokens the lexer produces), a set of production rules (rewrite rules), and a start symbol. A derivation starts from the start symbol and repeatedly replaces non-terminals with production right-hand sides until only terminals remain. The language of a grammar G is the set of all terminal strings reachable from the start symbol.

> **Definition — Context-Free Grammar:**
> A CFG is a 4-tuple G = (V, Σ, R, S) where:
> - V is a finite set of non-terminal symbols (grammar variables)
> - Σ is a finite set of terminal symbols (tokens), V ∩ Σ = ∅
> - R ⊆ V × (V ∪ Σ)* is a finite set of production rules
> - S ∈ V is the start symbol
>
> A production rule A → α means the non-terminal A can be replaced by the symbol string α.
> A grammar generates the language L(G) = { w ∈ Σ* | S ⇒* w } — all terminal strings
> derivable from S in zero or more steps.

## BNF Notation

Production rules are written in Backus-Naur Form (BNF): `A → α` means A can be rewritten as α. The vertical bar `|` separates alternatives, so `A → α | β` is shorthand for two rules. Non-terminals are written in CamelCase; terminals are UPPERCASE (matching Alpaca's token name conventions).

EBNF (Extended BNF) adds optional elements `[...]`, repetition `{...}`, and grouping `(...)`. These shorthands can always be translated into plain BNF, but are useful for compact notation. This page uses BNF throughout for clarity; Alpaca's DSL maps directly to BNF productions.

## The Calculator Grammar

The calculator grammar is the running example for the entire Compiler Theory Tutorial. It defines arithmetic expressions with four operators and parentheses:

```
Expr  → Expr PLUS Expr
      | Expr MINUS Expr
      | Expr TIMES Expr
      | Expr DIVIDE Expr
      | LPAREN Expr RPAREN
      | NUMBER

root  → Expr
```

Identifying the 4-tuple components:

- V = {Expr, root} — two non-terminals
- Σ = {NUMBER, PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, DIVIDE, LPAREN, RPAREN} — seven terminal symbols, produced by CalcLexer
- R = the 7 production rules above
- S = root — the start symbol

Note: this grammar is **ambiguous** — the expression `1 + 2 * 3` can be parsed in two ways depending on which `Expr` is expanded first. We will see how Alpaca resolves ambiguities on the [Conflict Resolution](../conflict-resolution.md) page.

## Derivation

A *derivation* is a sequence of rewriting steps from the start symbol to a terminal string. Each step replaces the leftmost non-terminal with one of its production alternatives (leftmost derivation).

Leftmost derivation for `1 + 2`:

```
root ⇒ Expr
     ⇒ Expr PLUS Expr        (apply: Expr → Expr PLUS Expr)
     ⇒ NUMBER PLUS Expr      (apply: Expr → NUMBER, leftmost)
     ⇒ NUMBER PLUS NUMBER    (apply: Expr → NUMBER, leftmost)
```

The first step applies `root → Expr`; the second expands the leftmost `Expr` using the `Expr PLUS Expr` production; the third and fourth substitute the literal `NUMBER` terminal for each remaining `Expr`.

## Parse Trees

A parse tree captures the grammatical structure of a derivation as a tree. Each internal node is a non-terminal; each leaf is a terminal. The parse tree for `1 + 2`:

```
         root
          |
         Expr
        / | \
      Expr PLUS Expr
       |          |
     NUMBER     NUMBER
     (1.0)      (2.0)
```

Note: In Alpaca, the parse tree is never exposed to user code. The `Parser` macro builds it internally during the shift-reduce parse, and immediately evaluates your semantic actions (the `=>` expressions in `rule` definitions) as each node is reduced. What `parse()` returns is the typed result — a `Double` in the calculator case — not an intermediate tree object. (See [The Compilation Pipeline](pipeline.md) for the full picture.)

## Alpaca DSL Mapping

The calculator grammar maps directly to an Alpaca `Parser` definition. Each production rule becomes a case clause in a `rule(...)` call; the right-hand side pattern matches the grammatical structure, and the right-hand side expression computes the result.

```scala sc:nocompile
import alpaca.*

object CalcParser extends Parser:
  val Expr: Rule[Double] = rule(
    { case (Expr(a), CalcLexer.PLUS(_), Expr(b))   => a + b },
    { case (Expr(a), CalcLexer.MINUS(_), Expr(b))  => a - b },
    { case (Expr(a), CalcLexer.TIMES(_), Expr(b))  => a * b },
    { case (Expr(a), CalcLexer.DIVIDE(_), Expr(b)) => a / b },
    { case (CalcLexer.LPAREN(_), Expr(e), CalcLexer.RPAREN(_)) => e },
    { case CalcLexer.NUMBER(n) => n.value },
  )
  val root: Rule[Double] = rule:
    case Expr(v) => v
```

Each `case` clause corresponds to one production rule. `Expr(a)` matches a reduced `Expr` non-terminal with value `a`. `CalcLexer.PLUS(_)` matches the PLUS terminal (the `_` discards the lexeme value since PLUS carries `Unit`). `CalcLexer.NUMBER(n)` matches a NUMBER terminal; `n.value` accesses the `Double` extracted by the lexer. The grammar's non-terminals (`Expr`, `root`) become `Rule[Double]` values; the type parameter is the result type of each reduction.

> **Compile-time processing:** When you define `object CalcParser extends Parser`, the Alpaca macro reads every `rule` declaration and constructs the LR(1) parse table at compile time.
