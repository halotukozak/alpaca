# Alpaca Documentation Extension

## Vision
To provide comprehensive, clear, and easy-to-follow documentation for the Alpaca lexer and parser library, making it accessible to Scala developers of all levels. The goal is to move beyond a simple "Getting Started" guide to detailed tutorials, API references, and advanced usage examples.

## Core Features to Document
- DSL syntax for Lexers and Parsers.
- Context-aware lexing and parsing.
- Error handling and debugging (using the `debug/` directory).
- Integration with Mill and Scala CLI.
- Performance considerations and benchmarks.
- Advanced macro features (if applicable to users).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation (Scaladoc).
- [ ] At least 3 detailed tutorials (Simple Math, JSON, and a Contextual example).
- [ ] Debugging guide updated with CSV table explanation.
- [ ] "Getting Started" guide refined for clarity.
- [ ] Clear installation instructions for all major build tools.
