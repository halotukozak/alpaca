# Alpaca IntelliJ Plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial release: IDE support for languages defined with the [Alpaca](https://github.com/halotukozak-com/alpaca) lexer/parser library, driven entirely by the grammar data Alpaca exports at compile time (`ALPACA_GRAMMAR_EXPORT_DIR`).
- Syntax highlighting inferred from each token's regex shape.
- A real PSI parser that drives the exported, conflict-resolved LR table; syntax errors surface as ordinary error annotations.
- Structure View mirroring the parsed tree, one entry per grammar rule.
- Code folding for any rule whose text spans more than one line.
- Grammar-driven autocompletion of the fixed-spelling terminals valid at the caret.
- Line comment toggling (`Ctrl+/`) for grammars that ignore a `prefix.*`-shaped rule.
- Settings panel (**Settings | Tools | Alpaca**) for the grammar export directory and per-extension language mappings.
