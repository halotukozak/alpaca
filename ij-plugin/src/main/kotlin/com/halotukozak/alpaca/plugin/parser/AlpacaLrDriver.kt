/**
 * A generic, grammar-agnostic LR parser: drives a [TreeBuilder] using [table], Alpaca's already
 * conflict-resolved parse table (currently LALR(1); see `ParseTable` on the Scala side), producing
 * one composite node per reduced nonterminal. The table alone decides every shift/reduce/goto
 * choice, including precedence and associativity, since those were already settled when the table
 * was built. This driver only replays the table, so it's unaffected by which LR variant produced it.
 *
 * Building a top-down PSI tree from a bottom-up parse needs a marker per still-unreduced stack
 * symbol, not just one per production. A reduction's first RHS symbol is often a plain terminal
 * (`sin` in `Expr -> sin ( Expr )`), so there's no earlier nonterminal marker to piggyback on the
 * way a recursive-descent parser gets for free from left recursion. [TreeBuilder.precede] makes
 * marking every shift affordable: an unresolved marker costs nothing until it's actually turned
 * into a node, or dropped without one.
