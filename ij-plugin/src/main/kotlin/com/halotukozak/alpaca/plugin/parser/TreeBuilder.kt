 *
 * [M] mirrors `PsiBuilder.Marker`: an opaque handle to a not-yet-resolved position. A marker
 * resolves to a composite node via [done]. It can also vanish via [drop], in which case its
 * would-be children rejoin whatever ends up enclosing them. [precede] wraps everything from a
 * marker's own start up to the current position in a new, independent marker. Bottom-up
 * (shift-reduce) parsing needs that: a reduction only recognizes "this span should have been one
 * node" after the span has already been consumed.
