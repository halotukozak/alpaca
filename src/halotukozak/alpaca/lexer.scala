 * and a setter for every case field that doesn't already have a real setter,
 * e.g. for `case class Ctx(count: Int)`: `C { def count: Int; def count_=(v:
 * Int): Unit }`. This is what lets `ctx.count += 1` type-check even when
 * `count` is an immutable `val` — the real getter always wins over the
 * structural one, but the structural setter is used since there is no real
 * one. The `lexer` macro then rewrites every such structural assignment back
 * into a `copy` (see [[RewriteCtxMutations]]) before the rule is compiled, so
 * the structural setter is never actually invoked at runtime for a `case
 * class` context: this type exists purely to make the mutation-looking
 * syntax type-check. Contexts that still declare `var` fields are
 * unaffected: the real `var` setter shadows the structural one and the
 * assignment mutates in place, exactly as before, and in fact never gains a
 * refinement member in the first place.
 *
 * `C` is inferred as a fresh, unbound type parameter from whatever context
 * function currently binds `c` — deliberately *not* `c.type`: refining the
 * singleton type of the specific enclosing lambda parameter, rather than the
 * nominal class `C`, is what a `lexer` rule's own macro (which tears the
 * rule apart and rebuilds its pieces as fresh lambdas — see `Lexer.scala`)
 * empirically stumbles on downstream, even though the two only differ in
 * which stable path they're attached to.
