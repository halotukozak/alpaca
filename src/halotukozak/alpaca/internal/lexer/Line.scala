/**
 * A context fragment that tracks the current 1-based line number.
 *
 * Use it as a field of a lexer context:
 * {{{
 * case class MyCtx(line: Line = Line.Start) extends LexerCtx
 * }}}
 *
 * [[Tracking.materialize]] finds the `given Tracking[Line]` below and applies it
 * to that field after every match, threading a functional `copy` -- so `line`
 * stays an immutable `val`. `Line <: Int`, so `ctx.line` reads as a plain `Int`
 * everywhere; assigning it inside a rule body (`ctx.line = Line(...)`) is
 * rewritten to a `copy` too.
